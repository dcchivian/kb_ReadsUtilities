    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Merge Multiple ReadsLibs to One ReadsLib</b> allows a user to combine reads sets and/or reads libraries into a single library (if merging a single Reads Set into one Library, use <b>Merge ReadsSet to One Library</b> App instead).  This can be necessary for certain Apps that cannot accept more than one reads library, such as for performing co-assemblies.  This App does not account for repeat IDs and will include all reads even if they are identical IDs or sequence.  Merged Reads Libraries must all be Paired End or Single End Libraries.
