    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Split Reads</b> allows a user to split sequences from a larger Single End or Paired End Reads Library into two or more evenly-sized libraries (may be off by one sequence if the split number does not evenly divide the number of source reads).  The output sub-libraries will be organized into a corresponding Reads Set.
