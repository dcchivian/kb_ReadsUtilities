    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Merge ReadsSet to One Library</b> allows a user to combine the Reads Libraries from one Reads Set into one Reads Library (if merging a multiple Reads Sets into one Library, use <b>Merge Multiple ReadsLibs to One Library</b> App instead).  This can be necessary for certain Apps that cannot accept more than one reads library, such as for performing co-assemblies.  This App does not account for repeat IDs and will include all reads even if they are identical IDs or sequence.  The members of the <b><i>Reads Set</i></b> must all be either <b><i>Paired End Libraries</i></b> or <b><i>Single End Libraries</i></b> to allow for merging into one output library.
    </p>
